Open the utils directory,
Edit the binance_api.py script to enter your API keys for
	-> mainnet
	-> testnet {if needed}

WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING!!!
-------------------------------------------------
If your are running on testnet, set the TESTNET global variable in the 
binance_api.py script to true. Else, it will trade with your assets if the 
API_KEYS & API_SECRET are set.

Also I have given the bot full permission to trade only if its error compared 
to true value is <= 0.5, you can change that by altering the argument in the 
method:
	async def test_iterator(self,
			valid_margin = 0.5
			)

I set PROFIT_MARGIN = LOSS_MARGIN = 0.2 {Making these values too big increases 
	chances of making losses. Making it too small on the other hand makes it 
	exists in the market without actually performing any trades.
}
-------------------------------------------------

This bot runs for an hour after which it prompts you to allow it continue with 
session. You can modify that and make it more fexible by editing this line:

	if (float(time.time()) - LOGIN_TIMESTAMP) >= (60**2):#BREAK AFTER 1hr

You can instantiate multiple sessions by invoking:

	bot = BotSession(
		base_asset = "<prefered base asset e.g BNB>", 
		quote_asset = "<prefered quote asset e.g USDT>",
	       )

---------------------------------------------------
In testnet, I am still landing in filter issues for SPOT trading

HAPPY TRADING!
